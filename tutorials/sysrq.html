  <meta name="description" content="Hi, I'm OgloTheNerd!
  I am a Linux/programming content creator, and I create open source stuff!
  There are two types of programmers: the soy JS/TS devs who are in it for the money,
  and the ones who enjoy programming and learning about how the OS works and stuff.
  I am the second type. I enjoy learning about how the tech I use works. I even made
  my own CPU ISA and an emulator for it! I also got sick of writing bytecode by hand,
  so I created an assembler. Check my stuff out, you might enjoy it!">

<h2 id="what-the-heck-is-sysrq">[1] What the heck is SysRQ?</h2>
<p>SysRQ is a key on your keyboard. If you don’t see it, chances are
your PrtSc key doubles as it. The insert key and PrtSc/SysRQ key are
usually right next to each other, near where your numpad would be.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-sysrq-do-exactly-and-how-can-it-save-my-system">[2]
What does SysRQ do exactly, and how can it save my system?</h2>
<p>SysRQ is the magic key (that is even what it is called in the Linux
kernel). You can use it to send messages directly to the kernel. Here
are some situations where you might want to do that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Your system freezes, and your only option (not knowing about SysRQ
ofc) is to hard turn off the machine. (I cannot think of any others at
the moment, this is kind of what you would use SysRQ primarily
for!)</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason you would not want to hard power off the machine is
because that surprises the OS. If the OS is in the middle of writing to
disk for example, it could corrupt the filesystem (which is not good at
all)! SysRQ comes in handy, because it talks directly to the Linux
kernel. So, even if everything on your system is locked up, you can
still communicate directly to the Linux kernel, with SysRQ. SysRQ allows
you to reboot your computer correctly.</p>
<h2 id="great-so-how-do-i-use-it">[3] Great! So… how do I use it?</h2>
<p>In order to use it, we must make sure the system is configured to use
it. You can make sure by reading the output of this command:
<code>cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</code></p>
<p>If the output is:</p>
<p>1: Enabled, and you can skip to section 5.<br />
Not 1: Not enabled, and you have some work to do.</p>
<h2 id="alright-how-do-i-enable-sysrq">[4] Alright, how do I enable
SysRQ?</h2>
<p>You can enable SysRQ with a simple command… sort of, see, you can
enable it with this command as root:
<code>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</code> But the issue is that
this does not persist after a reboot! If you want to have your changes
stay even after rebooting, you will have to run this at startup.</p>
<p>Depending on the distro, there are different ways to do this:</p>
<p>Generic Distros: You can enable SysRQ even after reboot with this
simple command as root:
<code>echo "kernel.sysrq = 1" &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf</code><br />
NixOS: You can do this on NixOS by adding one line to configuration.nix
in the global scope:
<code>boot.kernel.sysctl."kernel.sysrq" = 1;</code></p>
<h2 id="okay-now-how-to-use-sysrq">[5] Okay… now, how to use SysRQ?</h2>
<p>I mentioned earlier that all most people are gonna use SysRQ for is
rebooting their machine properly if it freezes. If you want to do this,
you have to remember 6 letters: REISUB A good way to remember these is
to remember: [R]eboot [E]ven [I]f [S]ystem [U]tterly [B]roken</p>
<p>If you want to actually do this, what you need to do is hold down the
ALT key, and the SysRQ key down at the same time. Once you are holding
them down, you want to press the first or next queued letter. And, you
need to release the ALT and SysRQ keys after every letter (command)
pressed. So, you would end up holding down ALT + SysRQ 6 times during
the REISUB sequence. I repeat, you can not enter multiple letters
without releasing your fingers from ALT + SysRQ, then putting them back
down!</p>
<p>What REISUB is doing:</p>
<p>R: Turns off keyboard raw mode, and sets it to XLATE.<br />
E: Send a SIGTERM to all processes, except for init.<br />
I: Send a SIGKILL to all processes, except for init.<br />
S: Will attempt to sync all mounted filesystems.<br />
U: Will attempt to re-mount all mounted filesystems as read-only.<br />
B: Reboot!</p>
<h2 id="did-you-find-this-out-yourself">[6] Did you find this out
yourself?</h2>
<p>No, I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/ZiX327d8Ys0">Chris Titus
Tech video about it</a>.</p>
<p>Definitely one of his few good videos.</p>
