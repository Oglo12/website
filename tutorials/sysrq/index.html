      [1] What the heck is SysRQ?:<br><br>

      SysRQ is a key on your keyboard. If you don't see it, chances are your PrtSc key doubles as it. The insert key and PrtSc/SysRQ key
      are usually right next to each other, near where your numpad would be.
    </p>

    <p>
      [2] What does SysRQ do exactly, and how can it save my system?:<br><br>

      SysRQ is the magic key (that is even what it is called in the Linux kernel). You can use it to send messages directly to the kernel.<br>
      Here are some situations where you might want to do that:<br><br>

      1. Your system freezes, and your only option (not knowing about SysRQ ofc) is to hard turn off the machine.<br>
      (I cannot think of any others at the moment, this is kind of what you would use SysRQ primarily for!)<br><br>

      The reason you would not want to hard power off the machine is because that surprises the OS. If the OS is in the middle
      of writing to disk for example, it could corrupt the filesystem (which is not good at all)! SysRQ comes in handy, because
      it talks directly to the Linux kernel. So, even if everything on your system is locked up, you can still communicate
      directly to the Linux kernel, with SysRQ. SysRQ allows you to reboot your computer correctly.
    </p>

      [3] Great! So... how do I use it?:<br><br>

      In order to use it, we must make sure the system is configured to use it.<br>
      You can make sure by reading the output of this command: cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq<br><br>

      If the output is:<br><br>

      1: Enabled, and you can skip to section 5.<br>
      Not 1: Not enabled, and you have some work to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      [4] Alright, how do I enable SysRQ?:<br><br>

      You can enable SysRQ with a simple command... sort of, see, you can enable it with this command as root: echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq<br>
      PLEASE CONTINUE ME - TODO
