<h1 id="fultiples---the-rules-2-players">Fultiples - The Rules (2
Players)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal is to shade five cells in a row either horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally before the other player.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Players agree on a grid to use.</p></li>
<li><p>After a grid is chosen, each player rolls a six-sided die and the
one with the higher roll is the first player. In case of a tie, roll
again.</p></li>
<li><p>Each player picks a different color for shading their
cells.</p></li>
<li><p>The first player shades the cell of any number on the grid to
start the game.</p></li>
<li><p>The players take turns shading a cell that contains a number that
is a factor or multiple of the number in the immediately previously
shaded cell.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue in this manner taking turns until one player gets 5 in a
row. You can get 5 in a row either horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a player gets 5 in a row, that player is the
winner!</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="additional-options">Additional Options</h1>
<h3 id="time-limit">Time Limit</h3>
<p>In Fultiples, a time limit can be chosen to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the game more difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the advantage away from people using calculators.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do keep in mind that grids based on larger prime numbers may need a
longer time limit since they are harder to calculate with.</p>
<p>If a time limit is chosen, each player (including the first player
who starts the game) has to complete their turn within the time limit.
If they fail to do so, they lose their turn and the other player gets to
go.</p>
<h1 id="clarifications">Clarifications</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>When starting a new game, another dice roll determinds who
starts.</p></li>
<li><p>After a player takes their turn, you don’t have to wait for the
time limit to finish. Instead, the timer restarts and it is the next
player’s turn.</p></li>
<li><p>A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and
itself without a remainder.</p></li>
<li><p>When each player chooses a cell, the number in the chosen cell
must always be a factor or multiple of the number in the previously
chosen cell. It doesn’t matter which player selected the immediately
previously chosen cell.</p></li>
<li><p>A factor of a number divides into that number without a
remainder.</p></li>
<li><p>A multiple of a number is that number multiplied by a positive
integer.</p></li>
<li><p>A positive integer is a whole number.</p></li>
