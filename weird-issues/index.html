Playback Not Working, YouTube Buffering Forever</h2>
<p>This was an issue I had on every single Linux installation of mine
except my Gentoo installation. The solution (Arch Linux) was to replace
the <code>pulseaudio</code> package with <code>pipewire-pulse</code>.
Somehow, I think this magically fixed the issue. I derived this possible
solution because MPD stopped playing music, and I looked in my config
only to see that it was using PulseAudio instead of Pipewire! So
naturally I thought that this might have something to do with my video
playback issue! :D</p>

<p>I remember getting this headset and loving how it felt on my head,
but realizing that it doesn’t work when I plug it into my computer. The
problem was that it would play tinny audio in just my left speaker. The
solution was oddly to keep fiddling with it and eventually clean the
tips with an alcohol wipe. This didn’t fix the issue entirely, I’ve
found that I also need to sometimes plug the cable into my computer
first and then plug the cable into my headset. Idk, it works. Can’t
complain. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
