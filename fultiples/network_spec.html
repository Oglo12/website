<h1 id="fultiples---network-specification">Fultiples - Network
Specification</h1>
<p>This document will go over the Fultiples network specification. The
purpose of this specification is to make it so clients and servers
designed for Fultiples can connect and talk to each other no matter what
programming language or design they use.</p>
<h1
id="current-specification-version-this-changes-with-each-new-change">Current
Specification Version (This Changes With Each New Change)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This number is always a positive integer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Version: <code>0</code></p>
<h1 id="communication-model">Communication Model</h1>
<p>Fultiples (multiplayer over a network) functions on a client and
server model. The clients connect to a server and send messages such as
where they made their move, and the server sends back messages telling
the client various things like whether or not a move succeeded or
failed, or if it is their turn or not.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-read-clientserver-specifications-in-this-document">How To
Read Client/Server Specifications (In This Document)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>First off, there are the global specifications like the data
types, and then there are the specific client and server
specifications.</p></li>
<li><p>The way you read the client/server specifications is that they
will have a list of messages in a table that contains the name, opcode,
and carried data (if any).</p></li>
<li><p>The simplest way I can explain how this table would translate to
code is as a tagged union. The name is the tag, and the carried data is
the union data. Don’t worry about the opcode in this explanation, since
it is for serialization and deserialization over the network (since the
network only expects bytes, not multi-byte data structures).</p></li>
<li><p>Message opcodes are 1 byte in size.</p></li>
<li><p>Opcodes are written in hexadecimal notation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="specification-network-datatypes">Specification (Network
Datatypes)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Number types are either a <code>u</code> or an <code>i</code>
followed by their size in bits. The <code>u</code> is for unsigned, and
the <code>i</code> is for signed. So for example, a byte is:
<code>u8</code></p></li>
<li><p>In the layout for each type, the parameters and their type are
written like this:
<code>&lt;PARAMETER NAME&gt;:&lt;PARAMETER TYPE&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>When serializing to individual bytes to be sent over the network,
integers are serialized in little-endian format.</p></li>

<h1 id="serialization-deserialization">Serialization &amp;
Deserialization</h1>
<h3 id="serialization">Serialization</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Serialization and deserialization in this specification are used
for turning messages which at the end of the day are represented as
multi-byte structures into raw bytes which can be sent over the network,
and then recovering the original message from those bytes once received
on the receiver end.</p></li>
<li><p>Messages are serialized by creating a new buffer (in modern
programming languages, this would be a vector) for the bytes, and then
pushing the opcode corresponding to the message to that said buffer. If
that message has carried data associated with it, the serialized bytes
of the carried data are then appended to the end of the buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>Carried data is serialized by creating a buffer of bytes (for the
carried data bytes), taking the layout (see network datatypes
specification section), and appending the serialized bytes from the
layout types/data to the buffer. This is a recursive operation since the
layout can contain types which in themselves contain a multi-byte
layout.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deserialization">Deserialization</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Messages are deserialized by reading a byte from the stream, and
interpreting that as an 8-bit opcode.</p></li>
<li><p>If the decoded message is meant to carry data with it, the data
is deserialized from the stream. If you are familiar with recursive
decent parsers, this process will sound familiar. If you were to think
of this as a recursive decent parser (which it is), the token stream is
a stream of bytes from the network.</p></li>
<li><p>If this explanation is still a bit confusing to you, keep in mind
that any algorithms implemented for serialization are essentially just
the deserialization algorithms implemented in reverse, since
deserializing is the act of reversing a serialization process.</p></li>
